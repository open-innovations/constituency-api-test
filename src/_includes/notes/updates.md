### Updates

We try to update datasets when there is a new release. If you know of a more recent update to a dataset, please [let us know](mailto:hello@open-innovations.org?subject=Constituency%20data%20updates).

Any dates given in the attribution are the date of the most recent data, which can lag the release date of the dataset.
