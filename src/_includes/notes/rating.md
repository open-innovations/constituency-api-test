### Rating

Ratings are based on ranking every constituency with data and using the following percentiles:

- ★★★★★ 80-100%
- ★★★★ 60-80%
- ★★★ 40-60%
- ★★ 20-40%
- ★ 0-20%

There are some cases where more is **not** better.
In those cases we have flipped the ranking so that a lower relative value would receive more stars.
For example, a child poverty rate of 0% would be ★★★★★.
